## üìò Overview

This book doesn‚Äôt just teach you to program: it teaches you how to **learn programming with the help of Artificial Intelligence**. From the very first chapter, the reader follows an accessible and engaging path, where AI acts as a co-pilot that speeds up the process without replacing true learning.

### Why use AI?

AI is like an electric bicycle:
- It takes you further and faster.
- But you still need to know how to ride.
- And if it breaks down, you must be able to get back on your own.

This book gives you that ability: to use AI as a tool without giving up on truly understanding how programming works.

## üìö Contents

The book is structured in chapters that combine minimal theory, guided practice, and real challenges:

1. **Can I really learn to program from zero?**  
   Motivational intro and first tools (AI + code editor).

2. **Your first (not very original) program**  
   The classic ‚ÄúHello, World‚Äù and why it still matters.

3. **Make it prettier**  
   What a self-contained HTML is and how to use it with AI.

4. **The first video game**  
   Building a basic game from scratch.

5. **Your second video game (maybe not)**  
   Expanding game logic, conditionals, inputs...

6. **Time for your online repository**  
   How to save and share your creations on GitHub.

7. **Study through synergy**  
   Use programming to review school subjects.

8. **Coding while learning in class**  
   Ideas for cross-subject projects.

9. **That Sounds Familiar**  
   Full HTML project: audio-based music guessing game.

10. **(Provisional) conclusions**  
    A reflection on the journey and AI's role in it.

11. **A few final links**  
    Online resources, repository, examples and extras.
