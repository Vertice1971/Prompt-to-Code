# This Sounds Familiar

**This Sounds Familiar** is an educational web application designed to work on auditory memory, attention, and music recognition through two integrated tools:

* 🎵 A **music guessing game**, with turn-based rounds and scoring.
* ✂️ An **MP3 cutter**, which allows users to trim audio fragments directly from the browser.

## 🎮 Game Mode: What Song Is It?

This mode allows playing in class or at home by listening to music fragments and trying to guess the song from several options.

**Features:**

* Selection of a local folder with `.mp3` songs.
* Initial setup: number of rounds and players (from 1 to 4).
* Playback of a random fragment from each song.
* Three answer options per turn (one correct).
* Correct and incorrect sound effects generated by the Web Audio API.
* Dynamic visual background that changes with each song.
* Individual scoring and round tracker.
* Final result screen with visual effects.

## ✂️ MP3 Cutter Mode

A tool that allows students or teachers to:

* Upload an MP3 file from their device.
* Select a time interval (start and end) in minutes/seconds format.
* Download the fragment directly as an MP3 file.
* No need to upload the file to any server.

The tool is useful for creating short fragments for educational purposes or preparing new rounds for the game.
