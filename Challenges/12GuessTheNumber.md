# Guess the Number

This is an interactive game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that challenges the player to guess a secret number between 1 and 100.

## Instructions

1. At the start, the player must choose between two modes:
   - **Easy Mode**: the game tells whether the secret number is higher or lower.
   - **Hard Mode**: starting from the second attempt, the game also indicates whether the player is getting closer or further away compared to the previous guess.

2. Then, the player selects the number of allowed attempts (between 1 and 10).

3. During the game:
   - The player enters numbers and receives clues.
   - The game shows how many attempts have been used.
   - If the guess is correct, the game ends successfully.
   - If all attempts fail, the game reveals the correct number.

4. At the end, the game can be restarted, returning to the selection menu.
